        <h3>History</h3>
        <br>
        <p>From the 1950s to the 1970s, only a small amount of plastic was produced, and as a result, plastic waste was relatively manageable.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>However between the 1970s and the 1990s, plastic waste generation more than tripled, reflecting a similar rise in plastic production.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In the early 2000s, the amount of plastic waste we generated rose more in a single decade than it had in the previous 40 years.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Today, we produce about 400 million tonnes of plastic waste every year.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>We are seeing other worrying trends. Since the 1970s, the rate of plastic production has grown faster than that of any other material. If historic growth trends continue, global production of primary plastic is forecasted to reach 1,100 million tonnes by 2050. We have also seen a worrying shift towards single-use plastic products, items that are meant to be thrown away after a single short use.

            Approximately 36 per cent of all plastics produced are used in packaging, including single-use plastic products for food and beverage containers, approximately 85 per cent of which ends up in landfills or as unregulated waste.
            
            Additionally, some 98 per cent of single-use plastic products are produced from fossil fuel, or "virgin" feedstock. The level of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production, use and disposal of conventional fossil fuel-based plastics is forecast to grow to 19 per cent of the global carbon budget by 2040.

            <h2>Genetically modified bacteria break down plastics in saltwater</h2>
            <img src="https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/styles/news_hero_tablet_1200x468_/s3/2023-10/shutterstock_1086143246.jpg.webp?VersionId=toZ57w9Xz7WiU4bgm2cx.j_PxC5sdk38&itok=upLIumde" alt="" width="500px">
            <p>Researchers have genetically engineered a marine microorganism to break down plastic in salt water. The modified organism can break down polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a contributor to microplastic pollution in oceans that is used in everything from water bottles to clothing.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The researchers worked with two species of bacteria. The first, Vibrio natriegens, thrives in saltwater and reproduces very quickly. The second, Ideonella sakaiensis, produces enzymes that enable it to break down and metabolize PET.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The researchers took the DNA from I. sakaiensis and incorporated its genetic sequence into a plasmid. Plasmids are genetic sequences that can replicate in a cell, independent of the cell's own chromosome. By introducing the plasmid containing the I. sakaiensis genes into V. natriegens bacteria, the researchers were able to get V. natriegens to produce the desired enzymes on the surfaces of their cells. The researchers then demonstrated that V. natriegens could break down PET in a saltwater environment at room temperature.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>"This is the first time anyone has reported successfully getting V. natriegens to express foreign enzymes on the surface of its cells," says Nathan Crook, corresponding author of the paper on the work, published in the AIChE Journal, and a chemical and biomolecular engineer at North Carolina State University. The work was done with funding support from the U.S. National Science Foundation.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>"From a practical standpoint, this is also the first genetically engineered organism that we know of that is capable of breaking down PET microplastics in saltwater," says Tianyu Li of NC State, first author of the paper.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The researchers acknowledged that additional hurdles must be addressed, but "breaking down the PET in saltwater was the most challenging" part of their work, according to Crook.

            <h1>Global Steps to Counter</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Global Plastic Pollution Treaty</h2>
            <br>
            <p>In March 2022, at the resumed fifth session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-5.2), a historic resolution was adopted to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>The Conference of the Parties (COP) is an annual summit of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The COP is the world's highest decision-making body on climate change and is one of the largest international meetings. 
            </p>
            Here are some things to know about the COP summit:
            What it's about
            The COP is where world leaders meet to discuss and agree on how to tackle climate change, limit emissions, and stop global warming. 
 
            <br>
<p>When and where it's held
The COP is held annually, unless the countries involved decide otherwise. The next COP, COP29, will take place in Baku, Azerbaijan from November 11 to 22, 2024. 
 </p>
<br>
<p>Who attends
The COP is attended by governments, civil society, business, and academia. 
 </p>
<br>
<p>
What's been achieved
Some of the most significant international climate commitments, agreements, and laws have come from the COP summits, including the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. 
 </p>
<br>
<p>
What's discussed
At the COP, countries discuss and decide on how to cut greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to climate change, and help countries build resilience to climate change. 
 </p>
<br>
<p>
What happens before the COP
Formal negotiations that form the basis of the decisions at the conference normally take place months ahead of the annual meeting at a "Pre-COP
